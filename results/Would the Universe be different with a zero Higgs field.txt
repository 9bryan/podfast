Apr 07 13:42:19  Orham Orham, a cartoonist and the creator of PhD comics, Daniel and Jorge explain the universe . Daniel is a particle physicist and a professor at UC Irvine . Jorge is a physics professor . Orham: Why does the universe taste this way and not some other way? Is it possible for the universe to have been different?
Apr 07 13:42:19  It's a very peculiar universe, pretty interesting and especially because of the fact that we're in it . You gotta wonder like if the universe was any different, would we still be here? Or were there some random twists and turns that determined the fate of our universe and might have set it on another course?
Apr 07 13:42:19  The discovery of the Higgs boson won a Nobel Prize and you were involved in that project . There was a lot of political jockeying for the Nobel Prize . One of the scientists involved in the discovery suddenly started to mysteriously disappear and pass away. Suspiciously. This is not a true crime podcast. It's also not a paranormal activities podcast.
Apr 07 13:42:19  The Higgs boson discovery confirmed the last bit of the standard model, which is the part that gives things mass . It's really an incredible punctuation mark on a century's long story . But I bet if the scientists suddenly started disappearing or dying under mysterious circumstances, fewer people would put their names out there . Maybe it would make it even more mysterious and attractive to people .
Apr 07 13:42:19  What do you think would happen if the universe's Higgs field was zero? Today we're asking the question of whether the universe would be different, or and how it would it be different if it were zero? We're talking to you, listener who has never volunteered. Write to us to questions at Daniel and Jorge dot com .
Apr 07 13:42:19  The Higgs boson is responsible for giving particles mass . Without it, particles in the universe would not feel the effects of gravity if they didn't have mass . And therefore, gravitational effects would not work in a universe where the Higgs field is zero . Daniel asks: What would the universe be like or would it be different if it were zero?
Apr 07 13:42:19  There's one for every kind of particle that's out there . The deepest question is why do we have these fields? Why do they exist? How many different kind of fields are there? And the answer is we just don't know . Electrons and photons, they all have some kind of spin, but Higgs bosons don't have any spin .
Apr 07 13:42:19  There's one electron field that fills the whole universe . All of space is embedded with all of these quantum fields . Higgs field is different from all of those fields because it interacts with those fields in a special way . It connects with them and changes how particles move through the other fields .
Apr 07 13:42:19  Higgs boson is what happens when you excite the Higgs field and you get a particle, but that particle isn't stable . Mass is really just a measure of internal stored energy, which is what we call mass due to the field . We're talking about how much force it takes to get something to accelerate .
Apr 07 13:42:19  The Higgs field only affects the mass of individual particles . Most of the mass, the proton and the neutron and therefore you and me and the earth, doesn't actually come from the Higgs . Mass is a really weird thing. It's this property of stored energy that it has inertia. And that's what gives it some inertia .

Apr 07 13:42:19  Exactly Amara: Most people don't have over $250,000 with a single bank . Any deposits we have are covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the FDIC . Each account is covered up to $250k; as long as you don't get more than $250K in an individual account or $500,000 in a joint account .
Apr 07 13:42:19  The way the fields work mathematically is that you just sort of think of them as a number or in some cases a vector at every point in space . And that field can have energy, which means that that number could be moving . If they wiggle, like the value of the field is going up and down . They can also have potential energy based on the different kind of field that it is .
Apr 07 13:42:19  The history of the universe is one where we are cooling down . The Higgs field didn't relax down to zero when the universe cooled down . When the universe was cooling down, the field got stuck in sort of like a local minimum . The field knows how to wiggle in some ways, the same way that like a guitar string .
Apr 07 13:42:19  The Higgs field is different from the other fields in the structure of the universe . It has a strange sort of potential energy function that has this double dip in it . So it's not just that space gets bigger, so you have like more volume with the same amount of energy, but the actual photons themselves get redshifted so they cool down even faster than the matter .
Apr 07 13:42:19  The Higgs field doesn't relax and so it has some kind of energy where our mass comes from . That energy is exactly where the mass of small particles come from . The interaction, as you say, comes from the energy of the field . There's basically two different versions of every particle, the left-handed and the right-handed version .
Apr 07 13:42:19  The Higgs boson can flip a left-handed electron into a right-handed electrons . It's a possibility just the same way an electron can radiate a photon . And so if an electron is flying through the universe long enough, then it will happen. This is the kind of thing electrons do. All the possibilities eventually come to reality .
Apr 07 13:42:19  Without the Higgs boson, all particles would all be split into their left and right-handed versions . This is like a new elementary particle that is made of these interactions . And the same is true of every other particle. Not split, but like each particle would have to decide if it was spinning one way or the other .
Apr 07 13:42:19  There's a subtle mathematical distinction between chirality and helicity, which is about the physical spin of the particle . Top cork is a combination of top left and top right, but a top cork can spin left . Instead of being combined together into the particles that we know, we'd have separate versions of everything .
Apr 07 13:42:19  Exactly Amada is powered by Energizer, makers of the number one longest lasting AA battery . During the month of April, shop the buy one, get one 50% off personal care sale happening now in the health and beauty aisles . We are imagining a universe today where the Hicks field is zero .
Apr 07 13:42:19  The Higgs boson unifies electricity, magnetism and the weak force together and makes a new force called electro weak . Without the field, we would have two different other forces that were separate, but very similar to each other . And the Hicks field changes both of them, and it sort of breaks them a little bit .
Apr 07 13:42:19  Without the Hicks field, you sort of untangle electricity magnetism and the weak force . It's not like you had the electromagnetic force and weak force and then Hicks field moshes them together into something that we still call two things . The weak force is weak because it gives so much mass to its particles that it makes them very short lived and very ineffective .
Apr 07 13:42:19  We wouldn't have light without the Hicks boson or the Hicks field . We'd have a universe with different force particles . None of them would be exactly like the photon, though they would all be massless . There would be a particle, the X particle, which is similar sort of to the photon in that it's a single particle that mediates a force that would be as powerful as electricity and magnetism .
Apr 07 13:43:11  Most of the mass in the universe doesn't come from the Higgs field, but the constructions that you make out of those particles do rely on the field . For example, you want to build an atom, you need to do that out of an electron that does have mass . Without that mass, everything would be totally different from what we experienced today .
Apr 07 13:43:11  A lot of people think that the Higgs boson is responsible for gravity somehow . But the connection between mass and gravity is only for elementary particles or other ways to get mass . Gravity would still operate, it would still bend space and change the path of particles, even if they are all massless and moving at the speed of light .
Apr 07 13:43:11  It sounds like the universe would be different if the Higgs field were zero is a big fat . We'd make the fundamental particles move at the speed of light, which would be totally trippy . And we'd also have more Higgs bosons, maybe we could win four .
